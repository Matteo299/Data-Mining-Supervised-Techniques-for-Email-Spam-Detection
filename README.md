# Machine Learning Techinques for Spam Detection

The aim of this project is to build a program that classifies mail as spam or not. 

## Description

Different data mining algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, KNN and Naive Bayes are compared to decide which one is most suitable for our task. 
This also includes preprocessing the text data to reduce noise through tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc., and selecting the features and measuring the performance of each algorithm through appropriate metrics.
The Enron-spam dataset available in Kaggle is used. 
The major learning outcome from this project will be in finding out which algorithms are best suited for text-based classification and in finding out the ideal conditions for the same.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* install Python and Jupyter

### Installing

* Since Python is an interpreted language there is no installation or compilation required.

### Executing program

How to run the program:
- Download the entire enron-spam dataset from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanderfj/enron-spam and put it in a directory named "dataset_enron".
- First run DataExtractionAnalysis.ipynb
- Then run MLClassification.ipynb

### Expected results

Graphs and results are available direcly in the different cells of the notebooks.
The final results (comparison between algorithms) are saved in a directory named "Results".
